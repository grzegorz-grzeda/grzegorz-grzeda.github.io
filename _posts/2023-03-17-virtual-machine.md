I created a library as an extensible virtual machine. Due to its simplicity I recommend it for small,
embedded projects, were we:
- run low on memory, 
- want to execute fast,
- do all the initialization/registering at the beginning of code execution.

Check out my [flow library](https://github.com/grzegorz-grzeda/virtual-machine).
